# NotesManagement_Project
A Notes Management Web Application is a user-friendly digital tool designed to help users create, edit, organize, and manage personal or work-related notes through a web browser. It allows users to jot down important ideas, tasks, or reminders in a structured and accessible way.

Built with modern web technologies like React.js, this app enables features such as adding colorful notes, updating and deleting them, and filtering based on categories or colors. The app often uses local storage or a database to preserve data, making note-taking more efficient, organized, and accessible anytime from any device.
